#' Overall per simulation-null-metric SES test
#'
#' This function provides one of many ways of summarizing and considering simulation
#' results.
#'
#' @param simulation.list A summarized results list such as one output from
#' reduceResults(). See examples.
#' @param test Either "ttest" or "wilcotest", depending on whether the user wants to run
#' a two-sided t-test or a Wilcoxon signed rank test.
#' @param direction Character vector that needs to be provided if spatial simulations
#' beyond the standard "random", "filtering", and "competition" simulations are run.
#' The character vector must be the same length as the number of spatial simulations that
#' were run, and can take the possible values of "two.sided" (for a two-tailed test when
#' the SES scores are expected to be centered around 0), "less" (for when the observed SES
#' scores are expected to be less than 0), and "greater" (for when the observed SES scores
#' are expected to be greater than 0). For instance, habitat filtering would be set to
#' "less". The relevant simulation to which these directional tests will be applied can be
#' determined by calling names(simulation.list).
#'
#' @details This function provides one way of summarizing and considering simulation
#' results. It takes as input a vector of all standardized effect sizes for all plots
#' from a given simulation-null-metric combination, and calculates the mean of the vector
#' and whether it differs significantly from a mean of zero. It does this either with a
#' simple two-sided t-test, or with a Wilcoxon signed rank test. If the latter, and if
#' there are three different spatial simulations with names random, filtering and
#' competition, the test is two-sided, less and greater, respectively. If additional
#' spatial simulations are included, requiring modified expectations, these can be passed
#' along with the "direction" argument.
#'
#' @return A data frame summarizing the mean, overall standardized effect sizes and the
#' significance of those deviations from expectations for each simulation, null, metric
#' combination. This test works across all iterations, and looks for overall shifts in
#' SES from expectations (see details for for expectations).
