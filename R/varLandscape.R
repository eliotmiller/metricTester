#' Create landscapes with varying degrees of heterogeneity
#'
#' This function will simulate 3-dimensional landscapes of varying complexity.
#'
#' @param cells The number of cells to divide each side of the arena into. Larger values
#' provide smoother looking surfaces, but values larger than 100 can require too much RAM
#' to run.
#' @param seeds The number of "peaks" or trait "optima" that will be chosen in the
#' landscape. Default is 1.
#' @param exponent The exponent to which the distances will be raised. Default is 1.
#' Values larger than 1 have the effect of making distance decay slowly at first, then
#' drop off more quickly at the end, while values smaller than 1 have the effect
#' of dropping off quickly and then decreasing slowly.
#' @param cutoff Values below which distances from the focal cell will be converted to
#' zero. This operates after the exponent is applied to the distance matrix, and after the
#' distances specific to a given focal cell have been scaled to min 0 max 1. The default
#' cutoff is zero, meaning that all but the most distinct cells are still influenced by
#' the new optimum of the focal cell. Increasing this number towards 1 has the effect of
#' minimizing the distance over which the focal cell influences neighboring cells.
#' 
#' @details This function forms the guts of a new habitat filtering spatial simulation.
#' The output from the function is a square matrix with values corresponding, in my mind,
#' to optimum trait values for a location in 2d space. Alternatively, this might be useful
#' for simulations of elevational gradients. A good sequence to show how landscapes can be
#' varied might be (all with cells = 100 and exponent = 1) to change seeds from 1 to 2 to
#' 10 while holding cutoff at 0. Then change cutoff from 0.01 to 0.1 to 0.9 while holding
#' seeds at 10.
#'
#' @return A square matrix of dimensions cells x cells.
