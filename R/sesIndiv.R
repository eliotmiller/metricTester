#' Summary statistics of SES results
#'
#' Summarizes individual iteration performance of each sim/null/metric combination across
#' all iterations.
#'
#' @param raw.results A list of lists of lists of dataframes; the results of a call to
#' readIn.
#' @param direction Character vector that needs to be provided if spatial simulations
#' beyond the standard "random", "filtering", and "competition" simulations are run.
#' The character vector must be the same length as the number of spatial simulations that
#' were run, and can take the possible values of "two.sided" (for a two-tailed test when
#' the SES scores are expected to be centered around 0), "less" (for when the observed SES
#' scores are expected to be less than 0), and "greater" (for when the observed SES scores
#' are expected to be greater than 0). For instance, habitat filtering would be set to
#' "less". The relevant simulation to which these directional tests will be applied can be
#' determined by calling names(raw.results[[1]]). Note that currently, even if a direction
#' vector is supplied, if the standard simulations were run then the supplied direction
#' vector will be replaced with the standard expectations.
#'
#' @details This function takes a raw list of results from multiple iterations from
#' multiLinker, and runs a non-exported function, sesSingle, over each element (iteration)
#' in that list. This sesSingle function runs a Wilcoxon signed rank test over each
#' iteration to determine whether the
#' plots from a spatial simulation/null/metric differ from
#' expectations. Assuming there are three spatial simulations named random, filtering, and
#' competition, this function will use two.sided, lesser and greater Wilcoxon tests,
#' respectively. If additional (or a limited set of)
#' spatial simulations are included, requiring modified expectations, these can be passed
#' along with the "direction" argument. It then summarizes the results of
#' those single run tests as the number of sim/null/metrics that deviated beyond
#' expectations and the number that were within expectations. A single run from a given
#' unique metric + null approach is considered as throwing a type I error only if p is
#' less than or equal to 0.05 for the random spatial simulation. It would be possible to
#' also assess whether such unique combinations throw the opposite signal than expected
#' for habitat filtering and competitive exclusion. A unique combination iteration is
#' considered to throw a type II error if the p value from  either the filtering or the
#' exclusion simulation is greater than 0.05. 
#'
#' @return A data frame summarizing the total number of runs per spatial simulation, null,
#' metric, concat.by combination, as well as the type I and II error rates of each such
#' unique combination.
