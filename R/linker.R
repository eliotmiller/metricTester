#' Run spatial simulations, null and metric calculations to test metric + null performance
#'
#' This function wraps a number of wrapper functions into one big metric + null 
#' tester function. Only a single test is performed, with results saved into memory.
#'
#' @param no.taxa The desired number of species in the input phylogeny
#' @param arena.length A numeric, specifying the length of a single side of the arena
#' @param mean.log.individuals Mean log of abundance vector from which species abundances
#' will be drawn
#' @param length.parameter Length of vector from which species' locations are drawn. Large
#' values of this parameter dramatically decrease the speed of the function but result in
#' nicer looking communities
#' @param sd.parameter Standard deviation of vector from which species' locations are 
#' drawn
#' @param max.distance The geographic distance within which neighboring
#' individuals should be considered to influence the individual in question
#' @param proportion.killed The percent of individuals in the total arena that should be
#' considered (as a proportion, e.g. 0.5 = half)
#' @param competition.iterations Number of generations over which to run competition 
#' simulations
#' @param no.plots Number of plots to place
#' @param plot.length Length of one side of desired plot
#' @param concat.by Whether to concatenate the randomizations by richness, plot or both
#' @param randomizations The number of randomized CDMs, per null, to generate. These are
#' used to compare the significance of the observed metric scores.
#' @param cores The number of cores to be used for parallel processing.
#' @param simulations Optional. If not provided, defines the simulations as all of those
#' in defineSimulations. If only a subset of those simulations is desired, then
#' simulations should take the form of a character vector corresponding to named functions
#' from defineSimulations. The available simulations can be determined by running
#' names(defineSimulations()). Otherwise, if the user would like to define a new
#' simulation on the fly, the argument simulations can take the form of a named list of
#' new functions (simulations).
#' @param nulls Optional. If not provided, defines the nulls as all of those in
#' defineNulls. If only a subset of those is desired, then nulls should take
#' the form of a character vector corresponding to named functions from defineNulls.
#' The available nulls can be determined by running names(defineNulls()). Otherwise,
#' if the user would like to define a new null on the fly, the argument nulls can take
#' the form of a named list of new functions (nulls). 
#' @param metrics Optional. If not provided, defines the metrics as all of those in
#' defineMetrics. If only a subset of those is desired, then metrics should take
#' the form of a character vector corresponding to named functions from defineMetrics.
#' The available metrics can be determined by running names(defineMetrics()). Otherwise,
#' if the user would like to define a new metric on the fly, the argument can take
#' the form of a named list of new functions (metrics).

#' @details This function wraps a number of other wrapper functions into
#' one big metric + null performance tester function. Only a single test is performed, 
#' with results saved into memory. To perform multiple complete tests, use the
#' multiLinker function, which saves results to file.
#'
#' @return A list of lists of data frames. The first level of the output has one element 
#' for each simulation. The second level has one element for each null model. Each of
#' these elements is a list of two data frames, one that summarizes the plot-level
#' significance and another and arena-level significance.
