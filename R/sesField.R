#' Calculate a species' standardized trait field
#'
#' Calculate the null-model standardized effect size of a species' trait field.
#'
#' @param field.input Prepped field.input object.
#' @param metrics Optional. If not provided, defines the metrics as all of those in
#' defineMetrics. If only a subset of those metrics is desired, then metrics should take
#' the form of a character vector corresponding to named functions from defineMetrics.
#' The available metrics can be determined by running names(defineMetrics()). 
#' @param nulls Optional. If not provided, defines the nulls as all of those in
#' defineNulls. If only a subset of those is desired, then nulls should take
#' the form of a character vector corresponding to named functions from defineNulls.
#' The available nulls can be determined by running names(defineNulls()).
#' @param randomizations The number of times the input CDM should be randomized and the
#' metrics calculated across it.
#' @param regional.abundance A character vector in the form "s1, s1, s1, s2, s2, s3, etc".
#' Optional, will be generated from the input CDM if not provided.
#' @param distances.among A symmetric distance matrix, summarizing the distances among all
#' quadrats from the cdm. For use with the dispersal null.
#' @param cores This function can run in parallel. In order to do so, the user must
#' specify the desired number of cores to utilize. The default is "seq", which runs the
#' calculations sequentially.
#' 
#' @details The trait distance matrix should be symmetrical and "complete". See example.
#' Currently only non-abundance-weighted mean pairwise and interspecific
#' abundance-weighted mean pairwise phylogenetic distances are implemented. The
#' only null models that are currently implemented are the richness and dispersal nulls.
#' The function could be improved by tapping into any of the metrics and nulls defined
#' in defineMetrics and defineNulls.
#'
#' @return Data frame of standardized effect sizes of species' trait fields. Table
#' includes the observed trait field, the mean and standard deviation of the species'
#' trait field after randomization with the chosen null model, and the resulting
#' species-specific standardized effect size.

#' character: closely related, morphologically similar, co-occurring honeyeaters have
