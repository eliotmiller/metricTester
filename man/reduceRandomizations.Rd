\title{Reduce randomized results to a manageable list of dataframes}
\usage{
reduceRandomizations(randomizations.list)
}
\arguments{
\item{randomizations.list}{The results of a call to metricsNnulls()}
}
\description{
The metricsNnulls function creates lists of lists of dataframes. This function will
combine the dataframes from each null model into a single data frame. The output is a
more manageable list of dataframes.
}
\details{
Given a list of lists of dataframes, such as those that come from a call to
metricsNnulls, where the first level of the list relates to a given randomization, and
each second level is a data frame containing the calculated metrics after randomization
according to a given null model, reduces the results to a simpler list of data frames,
where each data frame contains all the results from a given null model from the input
randomizations.list.

\examples{
#simulate tree with birth-death process
tree <- geiger::sim.bdtree(b=0.1, d=0, stop="taxa", n=50)

sim.abundances <- round(rlnorm(5000, meanlog=2, sdlog=1)) + 1

cdm <- simulateComm(tree, richness.vector=10:25, abundances=sim.abundances)

#below not run for timing issues on CRAN
rawResults <- metricsNnulls(tree, cdm, metrics=c("richness", "NAW_MPD"),
nulls=c("richness", "frequency"))

results <- reduceRandomizations(rawResults)
