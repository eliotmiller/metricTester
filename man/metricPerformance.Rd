\title{Summarize metric performance of a series of summarized simulation results}
\usage{
metricPerformance(summarized.results, nulls, concat.by = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{summarized.results}{The results of a call to sesIndiv() or plotOverall(). If from
plotOverall, the results must include the standard three spatial simulations (random,
filtering, competition), but must contain no other spatial simulations.}

\item{nulls}{By default, this function summarizes metric performance over all tested
null models. Alternatively, user can supply a vector of null model
names to summarize the results over.}

\item{concat.by}{Default is "both". Meaning that if both plot-level and richness-level
summary statistics are available, then performance will be average over both types of
results. Alternatively (and perhaps preferably), either "plot" or "richness" can be
provided and, assuming that concatenation option was specified in the multiLinker runs,
performance results will be summarized just over that specified option.}
}
\value{
A data frame of summarized results
}
\description{
Summarizes metric performance after reading in and testing
simulation results with either sesIndiv or plotOverall.
}
\details{
If an overall picture of metric performance is desired, this function can
provide it. It can also be used to summarize metric performance over a specific subset
of simulations, null models, and concatenation options. If provided with the results
of a call to plotOverall, the options are more limited. Currently, if provided with
such a result, the assumption is
that there are three spatial simulations, "random", "filtering", and "competition". It
then assumes that any clustered or overdispersed plots for the random simulation,
or any overdispersed or clustered for the filtering or competition simulations,
respectively, count as typeI errors. It assumes that any plots that are not
clustered or overdispersed for the filtering or competition simulations, respectively,
count as typeII errors.
