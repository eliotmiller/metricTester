\title{Simulate a community assembled according to habitat filtering}
\usage{
filteringArena(simulations.input)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulations.input}{A prepared simulations.input object from prepSimulations}
}
\value{
A list of 3 elements: the original input regional
abundance vector, the new spatial arena, and the dimensions of that arena.
}
\description{
Given a simulations.input object, will create an arena settled according to habitat
filtering rules (and parameters defined by prepSimulations).
}
\details{
This is the habitat filtering simulation that was used in our paper
(reference below). In short, species have phylogenetically conserved spatial
preferences, and individuals of those species are settled near that preferred location
with a controllable degree of variation. Species' spatial preferences are smoothed to a
uniform distribution. Thus, individuals are fairly evenly distributed throughout the
simulated arena.

tree <- geiger::sim.bdtree(b=0.1, d=0, stop="taxa", n=50)

prepped <- prepSimulations(tree, arena.length=300, mean.log.individuals=2, 
	length.parameter=5000, sd.parameter=50, max.distance=20, proportion.killed=0.2,
	competition.iterations=2)

test <- filteringArena(prepped)
