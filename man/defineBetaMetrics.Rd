\title{Output all beta metrics as a list of named functions}
\usage{
defineBetaMetrics()
}
\value{
A list of named functions
}
\description{
Creates a list of named functions, each of which accept a metrics.input object
}
\details{
All of the beta metrics we calculated for our manuscript are included in this
function. To add additional functions, they can either be defined on the fly or, to 
permanently include a new metric in all downstream simulations, it can be included
here. The function needs to be included with a name, and it must accept a metrics.input
as input. If the function needs additional elements not included in that input, then
the prepData function must also be revised.
