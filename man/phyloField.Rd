\title{Calculate a species' phylogenetic field}
\usage{
phyloField(tree, picante.cdm, metric)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Phylo object. Will be pruned to species actually in the cdm.}

\item{picante.cdm}{A picante-style community data matrix with sites as rows, and
species as columns}

\item{metric}{Phylogenetic metric of choice (see details)}
}
\value{
Named vector of species' phylogenetic fields.
}
\description{
Calculate the phylogenetic relatedness of a species to those it occurs with.
}
\details{
This function is being deprecated. This and the rest of the first generation
of field functions are being replaced by a two-step process akin to the calcMetrics
set of functions. The user first preps the data with a prep function, then runs the
desired metrics and nulls over the prepped object. This allows sets of metrics to be
calculated over the same randomized matrix, rather than having to repeatedly generate
the same random matrix for each metric. Currently this is only programmed to use either
non-abundance-weighted mean
pairwise or interspecific abundance-weighted mean pairwise phylogenetic distance.
Importantly, we are in the process of generalizing the phylo & trait
field functions, so they operate more like the calcMetrics functions. In other words,
the user will prep their data first, then choose which metrics to calculate and the
function will detect whether to calculate phylo or trait fields based on the inputs.
Take note of this, as code using the current forms of these functions is liable to
break when these updates are made.

\examples{
#simulate tree with birth-death process
tree <- geiger::sim.bdtree(b=0.1, d=0, stop="taxa", n=50)

#simulate log-normal abundances
sim.abundances <- round(rlnorm(5000, meanlog=2, sdlog=1)) + 1

#simulate a community data matrix with these inputs
cdm <- simulateComm(tree, richness.vector=10:25, abundances=sim.abundances)

#example phylogenetic field calculations
exampleField <- phyloField(tree=tree, picante.cdm=cdm, metric="naw.mpd")
