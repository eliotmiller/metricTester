\title{Output all spatial simulations as a list of named functions}
\usage{
defineSimulations()
}
\value{
A list of named functions
}
\description{
Creates a list of named functions, each of which accept a simulations.input object
}
\details{
All of the spatial simulations we calculated for our manuscript are included 
in this function. To add additional spatial simulations, it can either be defined on
the fly or to permanently include a new simulation in all downstream simulations, it
can be included here. The function needs to be included with a name, and it must accept
a simulations.input object. If the function needs additional elements not included in 
that input, then the prepSimulations function must also be revised.
